# Machine Learning Projects

About the projects:

The modelling of data sets are done on Pycharm professional software.
The data sets are picked up from the kaggle website where the best of the datasets are available.
The data sets used are:
a. Iris Data set
b. Mall prediction
c.Boston data set

The algorithms being tested in these projects are:
1.Linear regression
2.KNN Classifier 
3.Support Vector Machine

The regression analysis is also performed using python on a simple data where we have a linear line of points for X and Y values.
The model linearly fits the values.

Working on these algorithms are a basic start to my modelling aspiration.
